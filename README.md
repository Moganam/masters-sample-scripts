Imperial College London MRes projects

Seal_sample_script: Winter project on the impedance hearing mechanism of pinnipeds(seals and sealions)
Phylogenetic comparative analysis of pinnipeds and their close relatives. Analyses the differences in middle ear features to suggest hearing mechanism of aquatic vs. non-aquatic.

Bee_sample_script: Summer project on the morphological differences between mountain numblebees in the arctic,and their temperature preferences. Also projecting the impact of future climate scenarios on these species.

These are samples extracted from these masters projects as examples of my coding abilities. The data and results are not included.
